# Kite_ROS
Starting on the route to a robot controlled flying traction kite with python, ROS and OpenCV.  
Approach will be to do this the way people fly kites ie by seeing where the kite is and steering as desired.

The main documentation for the project, the plan and the decision logs for this are being setup at:

We are still setting this up and will add documentation and hopefully a few pictures as we go.
