#!/usr/bin/env python
# from ros wiki for initial testing
# kitebar will pick up

# this will publish final mesage back into ROS framweork and then routings would calc what
# to do next this message will be the actual angles - may well be similar format for desired angles
# but that will come later

so this should be publishing from the answer dictionary a new ros message based on the conversion of
the resistor values

we run this and subscribe to test we have end to end process
ther will be anothe message conv arduino and then basic motion detection picks that up

message should be barangle plus estimated force and perhaps any useful output from compass gyroscope
this then displays on basic motion detection and in theory we then have full capture and should
move to calibrate the bar angle part and then fly the thing again??
